# MAXX BURGERS - FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

- Frontend: React + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS + React Router v7 + Shadcn + Typescript
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Swagger + Typescript
- Auth: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Payments: Stripe
- Monitoring: Sentry
- Analytics: Google Analytics 4
- Testing: Jest (API testing), Playwright (E2E testing)

## DEVELOPMENT APPROACH: BACKEND FIRST ✅

**Why backend first?**

- Establish data models and API contracts early
- Frontend can consume real data from day 1
- Authentication system needs to be solid before frontend integration
- Payment processing requires secure backend implementation

---
